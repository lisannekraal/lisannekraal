      "content": "As a solo project I created a MVP for Catcalls of Amsterdam. Part of a global movement of 150 local initiatives, they create awareness around street harassment by literally chalking catcalls on the sidewalk. It being such an important issue, I contacted them to collaborate by creating a map visualization and a platform to report new catcalls. This would be a solution for managing their data, which now usually enters through Instagram messaging and is saved in an Excel, and offers a way for better storytelling of the data. I am currently expanding the app with moderator features and opportunity to expand to other cities. In production: January 2021.",

Because of its success, I thought there would be a better way to share my audio files amongst the people of this Book Club. Biggest challenge: working with audio and keeping track of the user's progress within each audio file.",
